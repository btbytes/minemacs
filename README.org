* minemacs

minemacs ("minimal emacs") setup to be shared between different langauge specific
settings.

I'm tired of chasing Emacs' "Omnibus Configuration Pattern". Instead,
I'll maintain emacs configs that are just enough to be productive in
one language, and import the common functionality from this set of
files.
